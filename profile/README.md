Hi,

In this organization, we share legacy projects, artifacts, and information with our partners. We do not maintain these repositories for the general audience.

However, we are engaged in several open-source projects. 

Here they are:

### [AX#](https://github.com/ix-ax/axopen) 

AX# binds SIMATIC-AX based project with .NET ecosystem.

### [AXOpen](https://github.com/ix-ax/axsharp)

AXOpen represents a novel application framework constructed on the foundation of SIMATIC-AX. It integrates AX# technology, seamlessly connecting Siemens industrial controllers with the .NET ecosystem.
