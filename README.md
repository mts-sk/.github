Hi,

In our organization, we share legacy projects, artifacts, and information with our partners. We do not maintain repositories meant for the general audience.

However, we are engaged in several open-source projects, which we publicly share and where you may ask for support.

### AX# & AXOpen

AXOpen represents a novel application framework constructed on the foundation of SIMATIC-AX. It integrates AX# technology, seamlessly connecting Siemens industrial controllers with the .NET ecosystem.
